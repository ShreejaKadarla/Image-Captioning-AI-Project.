🖼️ Image Captioning AI Project
This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can describe the content of an image using natural language. It uses a pre-trained BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model from Hugging Face to generate image captions. The model can analyze an image and produce a descriptive caption, bridging the gap between visual content and textual understanding.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python

Google Colab

Hugging Face Transformers

PyTorch

Pillow (for image processing)

requests (to fetch images from the web)

⚙️ How It Works
Model: BLIP model is used for caption generation, pre-trained and loaded from Hugging Face.

Input: An image is provided using a URL.

Output: The model generates a human-like caption describing the image.

📌 Usage (Google Colab)
Open the Google Colab notebook:
Image-Captioning-AI-Project.ipynb

Run the notebook cells step by step.

Provide an image URL as input.

The model will return a caption describing the image.

✅ Example
python
Copy
Edit
image_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/sfr-vision-language-research/BLIP/demo.jpg"
print(generate_caption(image_url))
Output:
